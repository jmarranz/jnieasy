JNIEasy - Java Native Objects based on JNI

Overview
------
JNIEasy starts a new programming paradigm, the Java Native Objects (JNO), JNIEasy is a full replacement of the Java Native Interface (JNI) to integrate Java and C/C++ based libraries and DLLs using Java Only and POJOs (Plain Old Java Object). 
JNIEasy avoids the tedious and complex task of bridging Java and C/C++ code with the complex and error-prone JNI with no C/C++ programming and using a Java friendly syntax.

JNO is like the transparent persistence paradigm into the integration world: Transparent Native Programming with Java.

With JNIEasy a normal Java class, with fields and methods, is reflected as a normal C++ class or C structure and vice versa. A Java integer, String, array etc is seen as a native integer, string, and array. No more strange Java artifacts, no more strange and unfriendly Java programming.
